# A Simple React Portfolio [DEMO](http://www.jonesxavi.tech)

## What ?

A Simple Portfolio built with React 17, [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). This is exactly 

## Why ?

To brush up React 17. This is exactly the same [portfolio](https://github.com/JonesXavi/portfolio-aos) site but instead of jQuery, I tried to replicate it with React Js.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
